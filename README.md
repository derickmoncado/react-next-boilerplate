# React + Next.js Boilerplate (with TypeScript)

Frontend starter kit with Lucide Icons and Embla Carousel, see details below :)

## Updating Dependencies

Keep the boilerplate current with these scripts (run these first, then fire up the dev server):

```bash
# Update package versions and reinstall
npm run upgrade

# Run Next.js codemods after major bumps
npm run next-codemod
```

---

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

How to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file (hot reloading).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
